Hello!

This is a single-page application built using Vite, React, and TypeScript. It initially fetches data from an API and displays it on one of the links in the navbar, using hash routing and the react router dom library, it modifies the webpage and its url without creating another HTML page to load. On top of "getting" data from an API, the application can also make use of "delete" and "post" methods to update the API based on the user input.
